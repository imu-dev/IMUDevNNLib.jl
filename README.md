# IMUDevNNLib

[![Build Status](https://github.com/imu-dev/IMUDevNNLib.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/imu-dev/IMUDevNNLib.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

Toolbox designed for working with Neural Networks. [NNlib](https://github.com/FluxML/NNlib.jl) is the prototypical package of this kind, which covers most of the common use cases; however, some processes encountered in the analysis of IMU-type data (and which may be found in other settings as well) benefit from other sorts of abstractions that are not found in [NNlib](https://github.com/FluxML/NNlib.jl). This package aims to fill this gap.
